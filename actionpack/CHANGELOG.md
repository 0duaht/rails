## Unreleased

*   Deprecate the ability to assign a single value to `config.action_dispatch.trusted_proxies`
    as `RemoteIp` middleware behaves inconsistently depending on whether this is configured
    with a single value or an enumerable.

    Fixes #40772

    *Christian Sutter*

*   Add `redirect_back_or_to(fallback_location, **)` as a more aesthetically pleasing version of `redirect_back fallback_location:, **`.
    The old method name is retained without explicit deprecation.

    *DHH*
